# C-BASICS
Welcome! I'm currently learning C programming, and this repo is my space for basic concepts, simple programs, and experiments as I go. 
If you're also learning C or just brushing up the basics, feel free to check out this repo and star it to learn along with me. Let‚Äôs grow together! üòÑ

## Tools & Setup ‚öíÔ∏è
I'm using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to write my C programs.
To compile and run the code, I use the following terminal commands:
```bash
gcc filename.c
./a.exe
```

## Referances
I am referring the C programming videos by [Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irqbmMNs2Bo&t=16856s) and [GeekforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/c-exercises/) for coding problems solving.
